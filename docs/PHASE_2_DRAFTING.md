# Phase 2: Drafting (The Architect)

The **Drafting Phase** is where the raw assets from Triage are converted into a structured **Implementation Plan**.

## 🎯 Goal
Transform "files and folders" into a coherent **Medallion Architecture** design.

## 🧠 Key Components

### 1. Execution Tab

### 2. Output Explorer
- **File Tree**: Browse the generated specifications and blueprints.
- **Preview**: Inspect the JSON/Markdown plans generated by Agent A.

### 3. Solution Config (NEW)
- **Technology Mixer**: Choose your target stack (PySpark, SQL, Both).
- **Design Registry**: Configure naming conventions and paths *specifically for this solution*.
- **Prompts Explorer**: View the system prompts driving the agents.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Review Context**: Ensure Triage context is correct.
2. **Configure**: Set your Technology Stack in the Config tab.
