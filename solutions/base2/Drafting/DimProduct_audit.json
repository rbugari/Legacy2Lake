    "No parameterized or context-driven path/credential hardcoding is present, which is good, but the code is incomplete.",
    "No handling for 'Unknown Members' (e.g., COALESCE or equivalent) in lookups or dimension keys.",
    "No type casting is performed according to the target DDL; the type safety loop is commented and not aligned to any provided DDL.",
    "Logging is present for error and info states, but no logging for rows processed (since no data is processed).",
    "Medallion structure is present as a scaffold, but no real Extract, Transform, or Load logic is implemented."
