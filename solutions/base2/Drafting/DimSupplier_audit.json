    "Extraction logic is a placeholder and does not implement the required source query. The code uses 'spark.createDataFrame([], schema=None)' which is not functional.",
    "No handling for 'Unknown Members' in lookups or surrogate keys (e.g., COALESCE(..., -1)). Even if there are no lookups in this task, the code should explicitly handle or document unknown member logic for dimensional loads.",
    "No schema enforcement or precise casting is performed. The code comments mention DDL is not provided, but the actual DDL must be referenced and enforced for type safety.",
    "Logging is present for errors but does not log the number of rows processed or provide detailed audit logging for resiliency.",
    "The medallion structure is present (Extract, Transform, Load), but the Extract and Transform sections are non-functional templates.",
    "No hardcoded paths or credentials detected, which is good.",
    "MERGE INTO is used for Delta, which is correct for idempotency.",
    "Business keys fallback to all columns, which is not recommended for production and should be explicitly validated."
