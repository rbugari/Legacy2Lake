# Legacy2Lake 🚀 (v1.3 - Contextual Edition)

**Legacy2Lake** is an AI-augmented modernization platform that automates the transition from legacy ETL ecosystems (SSIS, Informatica, SQL) to modern Cloud Lakehouse architectures (Databricks, Snowflake).

## 🧠 Core Capabilities (Rel 1.1 - 1.3)
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents (Detective, Cartographer, Interpreter, Critic) collaborating to build high-fidelity solutions.
- **Context Injection**: Incorporate "Tribal Knowledge" into the migration loop to generate **Virtual Steps**.
- **Operational Intelligence**: Automated inference of data frequency, load strategies, and PII detection.
- **Design Registry**: Global policy engine to enforce senior-architect standards (naming, paths, security) across the entire codebase.
